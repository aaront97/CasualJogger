Deviations from specified design scheme

For the most part, we have adhered to our original design scheme as specified in our previous submission. However, in some notable regions we have decided to deviate from this. For example, we have forgone the adaptive background colouring on the grounds that without more sophisticated information grouping and associated formatting, it would make certain elements difficult to read and colour grading across the board much more difficult. The precipitation chance graph and Rainmeter are now both coloured orange rather than blue, purely for aesthetic reasons. In addition, our Rainmeter now only ranges over the next hour rather than 2 hours, owing to data limitations. An unrelated problem was that although we had originally intended for our app to be able to lookup locations across the world, we have found it necessary to restrict it to lookup within the UK only, owing to implementation hurdles such as data insufficiency and timezone issues. Lines and boxes have been added in across the board to improve information hierarchical considerations, and the sunrise sunset display has been altered significantly to better endcap the app.
