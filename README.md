A weather app targetted specifically for runners, Interaction Design Group #29.

API Keys for Breezometer expires after 9-10 calls due to daily limits. 
If this happens, an error message 'API Call Limit Has been exceeded' will be shown on the weather app.
To handle this, create a new account with Breezometer and replace the Breezometer variable in the apiKeys.json file. 
This hindrance is due to the financial constraints imposed on this project.
